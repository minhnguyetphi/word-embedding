The code is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and macOS Catalina, with limited testing on Windows 10.  

## Requirement
The code requres 
- `Python 3.6+`
- The required Python packages can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download and uncompress [Stanford CoreNLP v3.9.2](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05.zip). Newer versions may work, but they are not tested. Either [set the environment variable to the location of the uncompressed folder](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/corenlp_client.html), or edit the following line in the `global_options.py` to the location of the uncompressed folder, for example: 
> os.environ["CORENLP_HOME"] = "/home/user/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05/"   

- If you are using Windows, use "/" instead of "\\" to separate directories.  
- Make sure [requirements for CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) are met. For example, you need to have Java installed (if you are using Windows, install [Windows Offline (64-bit) version](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)). To check if CoreNLP is set up correctly, use command line (terminal) to navigate to the project root folder and run `python -m culture.preprocess`. You should see parsed outputs from a single sentence printed after a moment:

    (['when[pos:WRB] I[pos:PRP] be[pos:VBD] a[pos:DT]....

## Data
We included some example data in the `data/input/` folder. The three files are
- `documents.txt`: Each line is a document (e.g., each report). Each document needs to have line breaks remvoed. The file has no header row. 
- `document_ids.txt`: Each line is document ID (e.g., unique identifier for each report). A document ID cannot have `_` or whitespaces. The file has no header row. 
- (Optional) `id2firms.csv`: A csv file with three columns (`document_id`:str, `firm_id`:str, `time`:int). The file has a header row. 


## Before running the code
You can config global options in the `global_options.py`. The most important options are perhaps:
- The RAM allocated for CoreNLP
- The number of CPU cores for CoreNLP parsing and model training
- The seed words
- The max number of words to include in each dimension. Note that after filtering and deduplication (each word can only be loaded under a single dimension), the number of words will be smaller. 


## Running the code
1. Use `python parse.py` to use Stanford CoreNLP to parse the raw documents. This step is relatvely slow so multiple CPU cores is recommended. The parsed files are output in the `data/processed/parsed/` folder:
    - `documents.txt`: Each line is a *sentence*. 
    - `document_sent_ids.txt`: Each line is an id in the format of `docID_sentenceID` (e.g. doc0_0, doc0_1, ..., doc1_0, doc1_1, doc1_2, ...). Each line in the file corresponds to `documents.txt`. 
    
    Note about performance: This step is time-consuming (~10 min for 100 reports). Using `python parse_parallel.py` can speed up the process considerably (~2 min with 8 cores for 100 reports) but it is not well-tested on all platforms. To not break things, the two implementations are separated. 

2. Use `python clean_and_train.py` to clean, remove stopwords, and named entities in parsed `documents.txt`. The program then learns corpus specific phrases using gensim and concatenate them. Finally, the program trains the `word2vec` model. 

    The options can be configured in the `global_options.py` file. The program outputs the following 3 output files:
    - `data/processed/unigram/documents_cleaned.txt`: Each line is a *sentence*. NERs are replaced by tags. Stopwords, 1-letter words, punctuation marks, and pure numeric tokens are removed. MWEs and compound words are concatenated. 
    - `data/processed/bigram/documents_cleaned.txt`: Each line is a *sentence*. 2-word phrases are concatenated.  
    - `data/processed/trigram/documents_cleaned.txt`: Each line is a *sentence*. 3-word phrases are concatenated. This is the final corpus for training the word2vec model and scoring. 

   The program also saves the following gensim models:
   - `models/phrases/bigram.mod`: phrase model for 2-word phrases
   - `models/phrases/trigram.mod`: phrase model for 3-word phrases
   - `models/w2v/w2v.mod`: word2vec model
   
3. Use `python create_dict.py` to create the expanded dictionary. The program outputs the following files:
    - `outputs/dict/expanded_dict.csv`: A csv file with the number of columns equal to the number of dimensions in the dictionary (five in the paper). The row headers are the dimension names. 
    
4. Use `python count.py` to count and get the final results of word count:
    - Load words from word_list.csv, grouping them by categories.
    - Initialize counters for each category, file ID, and year.
    - Process all .txt files: extract ID and year from filenames, tokenize text, and count words.
    - Write results to Excel: one sheet per theme, with IDs as rows, years as columns, and counts as values.
    - Save workbook as word_counts_theme.xlsx.
